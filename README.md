# FIPS vectors

These are the (large!) test vectors for my fips rust crate; they're
here to avoid cluttering the crate repo with large files/lfs
dependencies. See the fips README.md for how to unpack them into the
right directory for the tests to run.

## KEM

These were parsed in from the test vector file generated by 
https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber.git  .

## DSA

These are from https://github.com/smuellerDD/leancrypto.git ,
generated as:

```
meson setup -D dilithium_debug=enabled --reconfigure build
meson compile -C build
./build/ml-dsa/dilithium_44_tester_c > /tmp/a_file.txt
./scripts/parse_dsa_keys.py /tmp/a_file.txt dsa_44_keys.txt
```
